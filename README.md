# OR
The OR ( OPERATIONS RESEARCH ) course, taught by Dr. Ramezani, is a comprehensive study of optimization techniques used in decision-making across industries.

TOPICS :
1)Introduction and Problem Formulation
2)Linear programming 
3)Integer programming 
4)Nonlinear programming 
5)Constraint Programming 
6)Introduction on dynamic programming

GOALS :
1)Operational research 
2)Modeling: Derive a optimization problem 
3)Optimization algorithms: solving the optimization problem

( NOTE : For projects we use Pyomo ) 
( Pyomo is a powerful tool for formulating and solving optimization problems )
