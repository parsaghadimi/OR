# OR
The OR ( OPERATIONS RESEARCH ) course, taught by Dr. Ramezani, is a comprehensive study of optimization techniques used in decision-making across industries.

TOPICS :
Introduction and Problem Formulation
Linear programming 
Integer programming 
Nonlinear programming 
Constraint Programming 
Introduction on dynamic programming

GOALS :
Operational research 
Modeling: Derive a optimization problem 
Optimization algorithms: solving the optimization problem

( NOTE : For projects we use Pyomo ) 
( Pyomo is a powerful tool for formulating and solving optimization problems )
